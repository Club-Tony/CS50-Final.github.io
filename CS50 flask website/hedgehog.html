        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">1. Hedgehogs are known for their distinctive quills. When threatened, they roll into a ball, tucking their head and legs, and present a spiky defense. Their quills are not barbed, but they can still be quite sharp.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">2. Hedgehogs are insectivores, meaning their primary diet consists of insects such as beetles, caterpillars, and worms.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">3. In the wild, hedgehogs typically live for 2-5 years. In captivity, they can live longer, sometimes up to 10 years or more.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">4. Baby hedgehogs are called "hoglets." A typical litter consists of 4-6 hoglets. They are born with soft quills that harden within a few hours.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">5. Hedgehogs are known for hibernating during the winter months. They reduce their body temperature and enter a state of torpor to conserve energy.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">6. Despite their spiky exterior, hedgehogs are not fast runners. They are slow movers and rely on their quills for protection.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">7. Hedgehogs make a variety of sounds, including snuffling, hissing, and grunting. They can also create a distinctive snorting noise called "purring."</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">8. Hedgehogs are surprisingly good swimmers and are often found near water sources in the wild. They can swim across small bodies of water if needed.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">9. Hedgehogs are considered beneficial to gardeners because they eat many garden pests, such as slugs and snails.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">10. Hedgehog populations have been declining in some regions due to habitat loss and road mortality. Various conservation efforts aim to protect these adorable creatures and their natural habitats.</li>
