## TLDR: Download Sunset_Run folder, unzip, then download SunsetRun.exe separately, move the .exe to Sunset_Run folder.

### Detailed instructions:
### At the top: (My Drive > Sunset_Run) Click downward arrow next to Sunset_Run and click download.
### If not playing through IDE but with the .exe, the .exe file itself will need to be downloaded separately.
### It will likely be flagged as suspicious/containing malware (but there is no malware). I'm just an unrecognized publisher.
### When folder contents are unzipped, move SunsetRun.exe into the Sunset_Run folder you extracted.
### Run the .exe to play.
