## TLDR: Download Sunset Run folder, unzip, download SunsetRun.exe, move the .exe to Sunset Run folder.

### Detailed instructions:
### At the top: (My Drive > Sunset Run) Click downward arrow next to sunset run and click download.
### If not playing through IDE but with the .exe, the .exe file itself will need to be downloaded separately
### because it will be flagged as suspicious (but there is no malware). When folder contents are unzipped, 
### move SunsetRun.exe into the Sunset Run folder you extracted, run the .exe to play.
