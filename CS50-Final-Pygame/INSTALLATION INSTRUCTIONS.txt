INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

For playing the .exe:
Download the "Sunset_Run" folder from google drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/14eEOFYOJt43Cw41fB7fDK-_90E1IsdFD). 
Extract wherever. 
More than likely, the SunsetRun.exe file will need
to be downloaded separately, as it will be flagged as malware because I'm an unrecognized publisher. 
Download SunsetRun.exe in this github folder by downloading the raw.
Move SunsetRun.exe into your recently extracted Sunset_Run folder on your computer.
Run SunsetRun.exe, click run anyways as it will be flagged as suspicious


For playing through your local IDE:
Download the contents of the "Sunset_Run" folder except for the .exe as it's not needed
Access your directory to the folder through your IDE
Then download pygame if you don't have it already by typing into your IDE terminal:
pip install pygame
Run SunsetRun.py

It's possible that pygame window could fail to open on cloud codespaces, use local if you can.

Note: Make sure your computer's scale and layout settings are at 100% or lower. 
If higher, game window may be oversized for users with 1920 x 1080 resolution monitors.
If it is, this can be fixed by going to your computer's settings: 
(On Windows): Settings - Display - Scale and layout: 100%
